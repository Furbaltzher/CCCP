        <h2>Commands</h2>
        <p>
            <b>register</b><br>
            IRREVERSIBLE! Good luck if you were forcefully registered!
            That command that'll be ran by a parliament member, or you run yourself in <i>#checkpoint-a</i>.<br>
            Once ran, the lil' proto will recognize you as a soviet network user!

            <br><b>level</b><br>
            Displays your current level, experience, and how much is required for leveling up, as well as how muck bank you'll be making for leveling up!
            
            <br><b>whoIs</b><br>
            Essentially wikipedia for our citizens..<br>
            For specifics, specify an userID or mention an user. Otherwise it'll display information on whoever ran the command.

            <br><b>bal</b><br>
            Displays the financial status (OwOllars!!!) of an user. If an user isn't specified, it'll be on the user that ran the command.

        </p>
