    <h1>The history of the CCCP!!</h1>

    <h2>The ancient times.</h2>
    <p>
        The CCCP was founded on the social experiment concept.<br>
        The first one, made on December 12th, 2022, was between the CCCP's oldest members, rawr and Sno. It probably
        wasn't even known as a social experiment. Unfortunately, this was a success, and Sno was admitted in the
        original USSR, aka a puny group chat.<br>
        Because of the tragedy of the first social experiment, and the general lack of activity in the group chat, our
        infinitely wise OwOlord, Tato, just went ahead and recruited more dinguses into the group chat.. And it's
        bloating at 9 of the 10 allowed members.

    <h2>The founding of the server</h2>
    <p>Since the social experiments are <i>scientifically proven</i> to be beneficial. The social experiments must go
        on. So, the server was made. Yay! Originally meant to be more like an group chat, the server just broke out, and
        introduced some, additional stuffs Such as the fluffiest channel of all, the FSSR, and the introduction of our best friend, <a href="/CCCP/html/proto.html">Soviet Proto!!</a>
